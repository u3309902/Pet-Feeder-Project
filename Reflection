“Reflect on ethics and limitations Use Copilot to explore the ethical implications of using AI in automated pet care…”

Copilot highlighted key issues like responsibility and animal welfare. Who is responsible for making sure the pet eats? 
These insights influenced my final solution by encouraging me think about potential systems in place to make sure the animal is not neglected. 
Some solutions may be to include manual overrides, alert logging, and better malfunctioning detection.
I originally had a system that checked if the pet had eaten at the next food time but leaving an animal without food violates animal welfare.

“Explore real-world implementation: Use Copilot to discuss how your system could be built using actual hardware (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi).”

Copilot provided a comparison between Arduino and Raspberry Pi setups, listing components, pros and cons, and how each system would operate. 
As I do not have a great understanding of these tools I cannot reflect on this Ai suggestion completely.
This prompt highlights that I may not understand the topic and relying on Ai to inform me of the subject is not reliable.
