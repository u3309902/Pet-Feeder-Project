Test and Refine Sloution:
Does Pet eat and is it as expected?
- dispenser is set to dispense food at 8am and 6pm
- if pet does not eat it will send an alert to staff at the next meal time
- if pet does eat at expected time then the food will dispense at the next set feeding time
- if dispenser is out of food staff will be alerted and the pet will be feed
Logic and potential improvements: this system is logical, however, it is unknown if staff want to be alerted sooner if the feed is not eaten.
At the moment it alerts staff at the next feeding time which can be over 12hrs. However, it may take the pet the 12hrs to eat the food so
alerting the staff premuraturely is a risk factor if we bring the check bowl wait to far forward. 

Food bin is empty
- food bin sensor will detect if there is enough food available and staff will be alereted if not
Logic and potential improvements: this system is logical and can may be improved by alerting staff if food bin is low instead of empty to avoid
the potential of running out of food. this again is staff preference. if the food bin is too small then staff spend to much time filling 
bins and this negates the advantage of being an automated system

Comparing output with expectations
The outputs meet expectations. If the assumpstions stated in the first part are held, then each pet will be individually feed at set times
and staff will be alerted if the pet doesn't eat or if the food is empty. This system is now automated and reduces the work for the staff.
